    "## Brief summary\n",
    "\n",
    "### Random variable\n",
    "\n",
    "Given an experiment with sample space $S$, a *random variable* (r.v.) is a function from the sample space $S$ to the real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$. It is common, but not required, to denote random variables by capital letters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, a random variable $X$ assigns a numerical value $X(s)$ to each possible outcome $s$ of the experiment. The randomness comes from the fact that we have a random experiment (with probabilities described by the probability function P); the mapping itself is deterministic.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Discrete random variable\n",
    "\n",
    "A random variable $X$ is said to be *discrete* if there is a finite list of values $a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$ or an infinite list of values $a_1, a_2, ...$ such that $P(X = a_j$ for some $j) = 1$. If $X$ is a discrete r.v., then the finite or countably infinite set of values $x$ such that $P(X=x) > 0$ is called the *support* of $X$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Probability mass function\n",
    "\n",
    "The *probability mass function* (PMF) of a discrete r.v. $X$ is the function $p_X$ given by $p_X(x) = P(X=x)$. Note that this is positive if $x$ is in the support of $X$, and 0 otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Valid PMFs\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $X$ be a discrete r.v. with support $x_1, x_2, ...$ (assume these values are distinct and, for notational simplicity, that the support is countably infinite; the analogous results hold if the support is finite). The PMF $p_X$ of $X$ must satisfy the following two criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Nonnegative: $p_X(x) > 0$ if $x=x_j$ for some $j$, and $p_X(x) = 0$ otherwise;\n",
    "- Sums to 1: $\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty p_X(x_j) = 1$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bernoulli distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "An r.v. $X$ is said to have the *Bernoulli distribution* with parameter $p$ if $P(X=1) = p$ and $P(X=0) = 1 - p$, where $0 < p < 1$. We write this as $X \\sim Bern(p)$. The symbol $\\sim$ is read \"is distributed as\".\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Indicator random variable\n",
    "\n",
    "The *indicator random variable* of an event $A$ is the r.v. which equals $1$ if $A$ occurs and $0$ otherwise. We will denote the indicator r.v. of $A$ by $I_A$ or $I(A)$. Note that $I_A \\sim Bern(p)$ with $p = P(A)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Binomial PMF\n",
    "\n",
    "If $X \\sim Bin(n,p)$, then the PMF of $X$ is\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "P(X=k) = {{N}\\choose{k}}p^k(1-p)^{n-k}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "for $k = 0, 1, ..., n$ (and $P(X=k) = 0$ otherwise).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hypergeometric PMF\n",
    "\n",
    "If $X \\sim HGeom(w,b,n)$, then the PMF of $X$ is \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "P(X=k) = \\frac{ {{w}\\choose{k}} {{b}\\choose{n-k}} } { {{w+b}\\choose{n}} }\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "for integers $k$ satisfying $0 \\leq k \\leq w$ and $0 \\leq n-k \\leq b$, and $P(X=k)=0$ otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Discrete Uniform distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $C$ be a finite, nonempty set of numbers. Choose one of these numbers uniformly at random (i.e., all values in $C$ are equally likely). Call the chosen number $X$. Then $X$ is said to have the *Discrete Uniform distribution* with parameter $C$; we denote this by $X \\sim DUnif(C)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The PMF of $X \\sim DUnif(C)$ is\n",

    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "P(X=x) = \\frac{1} {|C|}\n",

    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cumulative distribution function\n",
    "\n",
    "The *cumulative distribution function* (CDF) of an r.v. $X$ is the function $F_X$ given by $F_X(x) = P(X \\leq x)$. When there is no risk of ambiguity, we sometimes drop the subscript and just write $F$ (or some other letter) for a CDF.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Valid CDFs\n",
    "\n",
    "Any CDF $F$ has the following properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Increasing: If $x_1 \\leq x_2$, then $F(x_1) \\leq F(x_2)$.\n",
    "- Right-continuous: The CDF is continuous except possibly for having some jumps. Wherever there is a jump, the CDF is continuous from the right. That is, for any $a$, we have\n",
    "\n",

    "F(a) = \\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} F(x).\n",

    "### Function of an r.v.\n",
    "\n",
    "For an experiment with sample space $S$, an r.v. $X$, and a function $g: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$, $g(X)$ is the r.v. that maps $s$ to $g(X(s))$ for all $s \\in S$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### PMF of g(X)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $X$ be a discrete r.v. and $g:\\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$. Then the support of $g(X)$ is the set of all $y$ such that $g(x) = y$ for at least one $x$ in the support of $X$, and the PMF of $g(X)$ is\n",

    "\n",
    "Given an experiment with sample space $S$, if $X$ and $Y$ are r.v.s that map $s \\in S$ to $X(s)$ and $Y(s)$ respectively, then $g(X,Y)$ is the r.v. that maps $s$ to $g(X(s),Y(s))$.\n",

Monty, who knows where the car is, then opens one of the two remaining doors. The door he opens always has a goat behind it (he never reveals the car!).
