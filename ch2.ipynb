Monty, who knows where the car is, then opens one of the two remaining doors. The door he opens always has a goat behind it (he never reveals the car!). If he has a choice, then he picks a door at random with equal probabilities. Monty then offers the contestant the option of switching to the other unopened door. If the contestant’s goal is to get the car, should she switch doors?\n",

Without loss of generality, we can assume the contestant picked door 1 (if she didn’t pick door 1, we could simply relabel the doors, or rewrite this solution with the door numbers permuted). Monty opens a door, revealing a goat. As the contestant decides whether or not to switch to the remaining unopened door, what does she really wish she knew? Naturally, her decision would be a lot easier if she knew where the car was! This suggests that we should condition on the location of the car. Let $C_i$ be the event that the car is behind door i, for $i = 1, 2, 3$. By the law of total probability,\n",
